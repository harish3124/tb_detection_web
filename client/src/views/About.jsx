      <div id="about">
        Coughing is a common symptom of several respiratory diseases. The sound
        and type of cough are useful features to consider when diagnosing a
        disease. Respiratory infections pose a significant risk to human lives
        worldwide as well as a significant economic downturn, particularly in
        countries with limited therapeutic resources. In this study we reviewed
        the latest proposed technologies that were used to control the impact of
        respiratory diseases. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a promising
        technology that aids in data analysis and prediction of results, thereby
        ensuring peopleâ€™s well-being. We conveyed that the cough symptom can be
        reliably used by AI algorithms to detect and diagnose different types of
        known diseases including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, asthma,
        tuberculosis (TB), COVID19, pertussis, and other respiratory diseases.
        We also identified different techniques that produced the best results
        for diagnosing respiratory disease using cough samples. This study
        presents the most recent challenges, solutions, and opportunities in
        respiratory disease detection and diagnosis, allowing practitioners and
        researchers to develop better techniques.
